Welcome to k-Wave-python's documentation!
=========================================

k-Wave is an open source acoustics toolbox for MATLAB and C++ developed by Bradley Treeby and Ben Cox (University College London) and Jiri Jaros (Brno University of Technology). The software is designed for time domain acoustic and ultrasound simulations in complex and tissue-realistic media. The simulation functions are based on the k-space pseudospectral method and are both fast and easy to use.
